# no void dwellers
void systems should not be able to run a voidshield. there is no good reason to sit in nothingness and want to be invulnerable.

# centric empire
strongholds that are closer to the galaxy center get a buff on defense point regeneration, reward for not voidstaging their whole faction.

# resource tycoon
strongholds could stretch whole resource systems and only the controlling faction can harvest resources there/gets a monopoly


# TODO features

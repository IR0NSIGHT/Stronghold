# no void dwellers
void systems should not be able to run a voidshield. there is no good reason to sit in nothingness and want to be invulnerable.

# centric empire
strongholds that are closer to the galaxy center get a buff on defense point regeneration, reward for not voidstaging their whole faction.

# resource tycoon
strongholds could stretch whole resource systems and only the controlling faction can harvest resources there/gets a monopoly


# TODO features
- events display info box
- events write to faction message board

- remote protection for far away gates
- system radar
- who is attacking my control point?
- make voidstaging obsolete by buffing area denial enough

        - voidshield hit
        - voidshield deactivated
        - voidshield activated
    - points mit "nav to" button
    - minimum survival time
    - current survival time
    - show on map button
    - center on stronghold
    
# notifications
- enemy controlpoint erected in own territory
    
# Gameplay/Mechanic Problems
- constant back and forth with CP conquering -> tiring out both parties
- no investment to raid or set up a CP
- attacker can raid/clear 3 CPs in 10 minutes

# controlpoints get shielded after an ownerchange (0->x)
- primary effect: whoever conquered the CP gets to keep it and collect points (/negative points) for a guaranteed amount of time
- intended effect: mindset shifts to "lets not loose this CP in the first place"


# BUGS
error on saving on serverstart
strongpoint capture on client join (maybe only if inside sector)


-> every conquering has consequences -> winning or loosing seriously impacts your efforts in the siege
-> every attempt at conquering has consequences -> you always aim to succeed and not just poke 
-> defender gets a home bonus (apart from secondary effect stuff like inv. defense stations)
-> a siege is slow and divided in steps that have to be performed one after the other.

"we have just lost this CPs to evil empire. Now the CP is locked for 2 days."
"in our war to conquer this stronghold we have had a good day, because we just conquered this CP. now we can finally advance to the next CP"


a siege is like a front in WW1. advance is slow and always costs blood and there is a good chance you loose the territory again the next day. you have to conquer the space ditch by ditch
-> CPs have a fixed order in which they need to be conquered/reconquered. artifical restrictions make conquering slow: every conquering locks down all CPs for some time.
-> one CPs per day => time for everyone to plan ahead
